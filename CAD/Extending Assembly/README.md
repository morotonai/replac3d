# Extending Assembly

This assembly contains the structure for extension and retraction for the replac3d project.

The extending assembly uses two NEMA17 Stepper Motors and GT2 timing belts two extend and retract four electromagnets. When energized, the electromagnets will attract to the build plate of the 3D printer. The motors will spin in opposite directions to extend and retract.

## Changelog

- V25

The motors do not include the belts, and there is no guarantee it will work in its current configuration.

- V51

The assembly is complete with belt clamps and a working (in CAD) path for the belt.
