# Extending Assembly

This assembly contains the structure for extension and retraction for the replac3d project.

The extending assembly will use two NEMA17 Stepper Motors and GT2 timing belts two extend and retract four electromagnets. When energized, the electromagnets will attract to the build plate of the 3D printer. 

Currently, the motors do not include the belts, and there is no guarantee it will work in its current configuration.
Below are two screenshots of the current design. For more information on the project, please read the project's README found [here](https://github.com/morotonai/replac3d/tree/main).
