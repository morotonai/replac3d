# Turntable Assembly

This assembly contains the structure for rotating the extending assembly for the replac3d project.

The turntable assembly uses one NEMA23 Stepper Motor and a GT2 timing belt to rotate the sliding assembly. The robot will be able to reach into the printer and extract the build plate, then turn right to deposit it, and turn left to pick up a new one to put into the printer.

## Changelog

- V29

The turntable assembly is complete with structure and power transmission.

## Updates

Printed the pulley, received the custom steel plates that I ordered, and finished assembling the whole thing.

I had to add 3D printed spacers on each of the turntable's bearing stacks, as there was not enough clearance for the screwheads.

I also added the covers on both sides for the thrust bearings (previously only one side), as the balls binded to the middle bearing and didn't spin.
